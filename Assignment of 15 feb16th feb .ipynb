    "# Differance between SQL and NoSQL:\n",
    "# SQl:\n",
    "# 1.SQL databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, use a structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data. \n",
    "# 2.They are typically used for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial systems or large e-commerce\n",
    "#   platforms. \n",
    "# 3.SQL databases use tables to store data, and each table has a predefined schema that specifies the fields or columns that the table can\n",
    "#   have.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NoSQL databases:\n",
    "# 1.NoSQL databases, on the other hand, do not use a fixed schema and are designed to be more flexible and scalable. \n",
    "# 2.Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Couchbase.\n",
    "# 3.NoSQL databases are often used in applications that require high scalability and performance, such as social media platforms or \n",
    "#   real-time analytics.\n",

    "\n",
    "# The four commonly used DDL statements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.CREATE: \n",
    "#    This statement is used to create a new database object such as a table, index, or view. For example, the following SQL code creates a \n",

    "# 4.TRUNCATE: \n",
