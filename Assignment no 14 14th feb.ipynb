    "# Q.5 State advantage and disadvantage of multithreading.\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Increased Performance:\n",
    "#       Multithreading can improve the performance of an application by allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously on a multi-core processor. \n",
    "# This can result in faster processing of tasks and overall better application performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Resource Sharing:\n",
    "#      Threads within the same process share the same memory and resources, which can lead to more efficient use of system resources and less overhead\n",
    "# compared to running multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Responsiveness: \n",
    "#      Multithreading can make an application more responsive to user input by allowing user interface operations to execute on a separate thread,\n",
    "# which prevents the interface from becoming unresponsive during long-running operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Scalability:\n",
    "#      Multithreading can improve the scalability of an application by allowing it to handle more users or requests without having to increase the \n",
    "# number of processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Complexity:\n",
    "#      Multithreading adds complexity to the application design and programming, as threads must be carefully synchronized to avoid race conditions\n",
    "# and other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Synchronization Overhead:\n",
    "#      Synchronization between threads can add overhead and reduce performance, as threads must wait for access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Difficult Debugging: \n",
    "#      Debugging multithreaded applications can be challenging, as bugs may occur only under specific timing conditions, and race conditions can be \n",
    "# hard to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Resource Contentions:\n",
    "#      When multiple threads access the same resources, such as files or network connections, they can contend for those resources, which can result \n",
    "# in reduced performance or deadlocks.\n",

    "# Deadlock and race conditions are two common problems that can occur in multi-threaded or distributed computing environments.\n",

    "# Deadlock Condition:\n",
    "#      Deadlock occurs when two or more processes or threads are waiting for each other to release a resource that they need in order to proceed. As a\n",

    "# Race ondition:\n",
    "#     A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which multiple threads or processes execute, and that order is not\n",
