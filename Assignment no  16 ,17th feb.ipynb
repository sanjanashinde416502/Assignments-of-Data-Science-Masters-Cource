    "# Ans:\n",
    "# What is MonogoDB ?\n",
    "#     MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is designed to handle large amounts \n",
    "# of unstructured or semi-structured data, making it a good fit for modern web applications, real-time analytics, and other use cases where data is \n",
    "# constantly changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Non-relational databases:\n",
    "#     Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data that doesn't fit well into \n",
    "# traditional relational databases. Unlike relational databases, which store data in tables with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases use a variety of\n",
    "# data models, such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph, to store data in a more flexible and scalable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "# MongoDB is preferred in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data need to be stored and retrieved quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Dynamic and flexible schemas are required to accommodate evolving data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.High availability and scalability are needed to handle large numbers of concurrent users and transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.Real-time analytics and machine learning applications require fast and flexible access to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Cloud-native architectures, microservices, and containerization are being used to build modern applications."

    "# Q.2 State and explain the features of MonogoDB.\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "# MonogoDB:\n",
    "#      MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that is used for its scalability, flexibility, and high-performance capabilities.\n",
    "# Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Document-Oriented: \n",
    "#      MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored in a flexible, semi-structured document format instead of tables with\n",
    "# rows and columns. This allows for more efficient and dynamic handling of complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.Dynamic Schema: \n",
    "#      MongoDB allows for dynamic schema design, which means that documents within a collection can have different structures and fields. This makes \n",
    "# it easier to adapt to changing data requirements and to scale the database as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3.Scalability: \n",
    "#      MongoDB is designed for high scalability and can handle large volumes of data and high traffic. It provides features such as horizontal scaling,\n",
    "# sharding, and load balancing to ensure that the database can handle increased data volumes and user requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.High Availability:\n",
    "#      MongoDB provides high availability through its replica set feature, which automatically creates multiple copies of data across different \n",
    "# servers. This ensures that data is always available even in the event of a server failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5.Querying and Indexing: \n",
    "#      MongoDB provides a powerful query language and indexing capabilities to make it easy to retrieve and search for data. Its indexing capabilities\n",
    "# allow for faster search and retrieval of data, making it ideal for applications that require real-time processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.Security:\n",
    "#      MongoDB provides security features such as authentication, access control, encryption, and auditing to ensure that data is secure and protected."
